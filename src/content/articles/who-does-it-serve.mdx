title: Who does your process serve?

One way to categorize process is to ask who it serves.

Productivity Process is there to serve the team doing the work. These proceses exist help them stay organized and be more productive. These are practices that raise the bar for the team. They facilitate learning, faster delivery, lower bug counts, etc. Ensemble work, TDD, micro-commits, small PRs, continuous integration, are just some of the processes that have found that serve the team.

On the other hand, Visibility Process is there to serve people outside of the team. These processes look to make the team's work legible to outsiders. Velocity, status updates, estimates, issue labels, heartbeat reports, etc. These things aren't there to the teams productivity, they're there to make it easier for people outside the team to see what's happening inside the team. 

Both categories are important. The team needs to get things done. Other people need to know what they're accomplishing.

Things get sticky when we don't know the goal of our process. Often times processes that increase Visibility actually detract from Productivity. Personally, I believe that aiming for perfect legibility is neither realistic nor desirable. But I'll say more on that another time.
