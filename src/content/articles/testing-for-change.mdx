title: Testing for Change
description: How using the RSpec `change` matcher can make your Rails tests easier to read and maintain.
---

Writing tests that check that a value you don't control has changed is a weird thing.

To help out, RSpec provides a [change matcher](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs/built-in-matchers/change-matcher) that can help make things easier.

Let's look at an example of how we can use the [change matcher](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs/built-in-matchers/change-matcher) to create more robust tests for our Rails app.

## The Problem: Tracking Changes to our Models

We have a `User` model and want to make sure that anytime it's changed, a `Trail` is created to record that change. Here are the models:

**app/models/user.rb**

```ruby
# == Schema Information
#
# Table name: users
#
#  id                     :bigint           not null, primary key
#  first_name             :string           not null
#  last_name              :string           not null
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :trails, as: :origin
end
```

**app/models/trail.rb**

```ruby
# == Schema Information
#
# Table name: trails
#
#  id           :bigint           not null, primary key
#  attr_changed :string           not null
#  changed_from :string
#  changed_to   :string
#  origin_id    :bigint           not null
#  origin_type  :string           not null
class Trail < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :origin, polymorphic: true
end
```

## Making Trails after update

Our first goal, is to make it so a `Trail` record is created anytime a user's first name is changed.

**spec/models/user_spec.rb**

```ruby
describe User do
  it 'creates a trail when the first_name is changed' do
    user = FactoryBot.create(:user)

    user.update(first_name: 'Something New')

    expect(user.trails.where(attr_changed: 'first_name').count ).to be(1)
  end
end
```

One way to make _only_ this test pass would be to add callback to our `User` model:

**app/models/user.rb**

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :trails, as: :origin
  after_update :create_trail

  private

  def create_trail
    return unless first_name_previously_changed?

    Trail.create(
      origin: self,
      attr_changed: 'first_name',
      from: first_name_previously_was,
      to: first_name,
  end
end
```

This is great!

Our tests passes. It's easy to read. What could go wrong? If we change the requirements so that a trail is made when we create the `User` then
things get a little funny.

## Making Trails after create

After adding a new spec to make sure trails are made on create:

**spec/models/user_spec.rb**

```ruby
  it 'creates first_name trail when the user is created ' do
    user = FactoryBot.build(:user)

    user.save

    expect(user.trails.count).to be(1)
  end
```

We update our callback to run more generally:

**app/models/user.rb**

```diff
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :trails, as: :origin
-  after_update :create_trail
+  after_save :create_trail
```

We'll see that our new spec passes (woo!) but our first spec fails (boo!).

## Magic Numbers

The problem with our specs is they rely on magic numbers. We've made too hard of a rule: there must be precisely `1` trail for our user after we've changed it's first_name.

How do we fix this weirdness?

## Option 1: More Setup

A little more setup could get us what we needed. By recording the previous count, we calculate the next count and match against that.

**spec/models/user_spec.rb**

```ruby
describe User do
  it 'creates first_name trail when the user is created ' do
    previous_trails_count = 0
    next_trails_count = previous_trails_count + 1
    user = FactoryBot.create(:user)

    expect(user.trails.where(attr_changed: 'first_name').count ).to be(next_trails_count)
  end

  it 'creates a trail when the first_name is changed' do
    user = FactoryBot.create(:user)
    previous_trails_count = user.trails.count
    next_trails_count = previous_trails_count + 1

    user.update(first_name: 'Something New')

    expect(user.trails.where(attr_changed: 'first_name').count).to be(next_trails_count)
  end
end
```

No more magic numbers!

Unfortunately it is a lot more to read and our specs are not as straight-forward as they once were.

## Option 2: Expecting Change

RSpec's `change` matcher is meant for situations just like these. When we pass a block to both the `expect` and `change` methods it we can hide all the setup we had to define explicitly in the examples above. Here's what those two tests would look like re-written with `change`:

**spec/models/user_spec.rb**

```ruby
describe User do
  it 'creates first_name trail when the user is created ' do
    user = FactoryBot.build(:user)

    expect { user.save }.to(
      change { user.trails.where(attr_changed: 'first_name').count }
    )
  end

  it 'creates a trail when the first_name is changed' do
    user = FactoryBot.create(:user)

    expect { user.update(first_name: 'Something New') }.to(
      change { user.trails.where(attr_changed: 'first_name').count }
    )
  end
end
```

### How to read a `change` expectation

These `change` expectations are a bit confusing at first glance, so let's try to break it down.

Here is the basic structure

```ruby
expect(block_that_does_something).to change(block_that_gets_value)
```

A rough re-write of this execution path might look like this:

```ruby
previous_value = block_that_gets_value.call()

block_that_does_something.call()

next_value = block_that_gets_value.call()

expect(next_value).to_not be(previous_value)
```

## Expecting more

There's more to the `change` matcher then I've shown here. Auxiliary methods allow us to specify by how much the value should change, exactly what it should change too, and also assert that it did _not_ change.

To learn more about these methods you can visit the [RSpec Documentation](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs/built-in-matchers/change-matcher)
